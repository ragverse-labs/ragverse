# 👋 Welcome to **Ragverse**

Work In Progress.

**Ragverse** is a modular, open-source framework for building and managing end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.

It includes:
- A modern **chat frontend**
- Robust **backend APIs**
- An intuitive **control panel** for orchestration and observability

Whether you're experimenting with LLMs or building production-grade RAG applications, Ragverse offers a complete ecosystem to help you go from zero to production.
