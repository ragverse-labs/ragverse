        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
        <p>Ancient Indian Scriptures and Texts contain profound and deep wisdom that is often challenging to understand
            and relate to. However, a significant issue lies in the fact that these texts are open to interpretation,
            adaptation, and improvisation, leading to the potential loss of their original essence.</p>


        <h2>What we learn is defined by how we learn</h2>
        <!-- <p><strong>What we learn is defined by how we learn.</strong></p> -->
        <p>In ancient times, the Guru-Shishya (teacher-disciple) relationship was central to learning, governed by broad
            principles that encouraged critical thinking and personal interpretation within a structured framework. Over
            time, the scope for individual interpretation has diminished. Today, we face a critical question: Are we
            learning through our own instinctive thoughts, or are we merely recalling someone else's beliefs? This does
            not suggest that learning should be without a foundation, but rather asks if we can provide a more original
            base from which people can derive their own interpretations within established guiding principles.</p>



        <h2>The Challenge of Modern Interpretations</h2>
        <p>Now, imagine adding AI to this complex equation. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
            frameworks like GPTs, which are trained on digitized versions of these ancient texts, the problem becomes
            even more pronounced. The crucial question arises: What is the truth according to the ancient texts,
            especially as more knowledge builds upon these constructs?</p>
        <p>As we engage with these texts in their modern delivery formats, particularly given the scarcity of original
            manuscripts, we often encounter the author’s interpretation rather than the text’s purest form. This limits
            our ability to draw our own conclusions, as was originally intended by the sages who composed these works.
        </p>



        <h2>The Intricacies of Questions and Answers</h2>
        <p>The relationship between questions and answers is fundamental to learning: answers emerge from questions, and
            questions from answers. Imagine the possibilities of learning if we could ask questions freely, without the
            discomfort or limitations of not having direct access to a "teacher" or "author." This dynamic interplay is
            crucial to developing a deeper understanding, yet it is often constrained in the modern context.</p>



        <h2>The Language Barrier</h2>
        <p>The diversity of Indic languages is both a blessing and a challenge. Some languages have greater
            accessibility in the realm of knowledge, while others remain obscure. Imagine if all languages were given an
            equal opportunity to be understood and to share their wisdom. This would open up vast new avenues for
            learning and interpretation, ensuring that no language or dialect is left behind in the pursuit of
            knowledge.</p>



        <h2>Introducing "Our Vedas"</h2>
        <p>In response to these challenges, we present "Our Vedas"—a sincere effort to return the gems of our ancient
            Indian texts to everyone for open conversation. Our aim is to provide answers that are unaltered and
            faithful to the original teachings, allowing you to explore and interpret the texts as they were intended.
        </p>
        <p>Welcome to a new era of learning and discovery, where you can "Know by Asking," with Our Vedas as your guide.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vedas - How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Our Vedas leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to support seamless multi-Indic language
            interactions.
            Here’s how the process flows: user input in an Indic language is first translated into English, enabling the
            language
            model to perform retrieval and generation tasks effectively. The RAG pipeline then processes this English
            input, generating
            a response based on relevant information. Finally, the response is translated back into the original Indic
            language before
            being delivered to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, AWS Translate is used for these translations, with plans to integrate Indic Translate and other
            language services
            in the future. This pipeline ensures accurate, meaningful responses while retaining the linguistic nuances
            of Indic languages.

        <h4>Translation and commentaries compiled by Mataji Parama Karuna Devi </h4>
        <p>The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a dialogue
            between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. In the Gita, Krishna imparts
            spiritual wisdom and guidance to Arjuna, covering topics such as duty, righteousness, and the nature of
            reality. The text is revered for its teachings on living a life of dharma (duty) and is considered one of
            the most important spiritual classics in Hinduism.</p>

        <h3>Mahabharata</h3>
        <h4>Translated into English Prose from the Original Sanskrit Text by Kisari Mohan Ganguli </h4>
        <p>The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. It
            narrates the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, two groups of royal cousins, and the
            fates of the Kuru dynasty. The Mahabharata is the longest epic poem ever written, and it includes a vast
            array of stories, moral lessons, and philosophical discourses, including the Bhagavad Gita.</p>

        <h3>Ramayana</h3>
        <h4>Translated into English by Hari Prasad Shastri </h4>
        <p>The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic that tells the story of Prince Rama's quest to rescue his wife Sita
            from the demon king Ravana. Composed by the sage Valmiki, the Ramayana is not just a tale of heroism but
            also a profound exploration of duty, righteousness, and devotion. The text is highly revered in Hindu
            culture and has significantly influenced art, culture, and religious practices in India and beyond.</p>

        <h3>Arthashastra</h3>
        <h4>Kautilya's Arthashastra Translated into English by R. Shamasastry</h4>
        <p>The Arthashastra is an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy, and military strategy,
            attributed to the scholar Kautilya (also known as Chanakya). Written around the 3rd century BCE, it is one
            of the earliest works on politics and governance. The Arthashastra offers detailed advice on various aspects
            of ruling, including diplomacy, war, taxation, law, and administration, and it is considered a foundational
            text in the study of ancient Indian politics.</p>

        <h3>Swami Vivekananda's Works</h3>
        <h4>Swami Vivekananda</h4>
        <p>Swami Vivekananda was a 19th-century Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in introducing Vedanta and Yoga to

            self-realization, and the practical application of Vedantic teachings in daily life. Vivekananda's teachings
            emphasize the importance of self-discipline, compassion, and service to humanity, and his writings continue
            to inspire millions around the world.</p>

        <h3>Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</h3>
        <h4>Translated into English by Yogi Madhvācārya / Michael Beloved </h4>
        <p>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is a foundational text on yoga philosophy, written by the sage Patanjali.
            Composed of 196 sutras (aphorisms), the text outlines the eight limbs of yoga, which guide practitioners on
            a path of self-discipline, mental focus, and spiritual enlightenment. The Yoga Sutras are widely regarded as
            the authoritative source on the practice and philosophy of yoga, and they have greatly influenced modern
            yoga practices.</p>

        <h3>The Rig Veda</h3>
        <h4>Translated into English by Tulsi Ram</h4>
        <p>
            The Rig Veda is one of the oldest and most revered texts of ancient Indian literature, composed in Sanskrit
            by the
            early Vedic sages. This anthology, curated and translated by Wendy Doniger, presents a selection of one
            hundred and
            eight hymns from the Rig Veda, offering readers a window into the spiritual, philosophical, and cultural
            dimensions
            of early Vedic civilization. The hymns encompass themes of creation, cosmic order, and devotion, providing
            insight
            into the beliefs and practices of the Vedic people. Doniger’s translation and annotations make these complex
            hymns
            accessible to modern readers, preserving the richness of one of the world's oldest spiritual texts.
        </p>

        <h3>The Upanishads</h3>
        <h4>Translated into English by Eknath Easwaran</h4>
        <p>
            The Upanishads are a collection of ancient Indian texts that explore profound spiritual insights and
            philosophical concepts.
            Eknath Easwaran’s translation brings these timeless teachings to a contemporary audience, capturing the
            essence of the
            Upanishads' teachings on self-realization, the nature of reality, and the interconnectedness of all life.
            Through accessible language
            and thoughtful commentary, Easwaran provides readers with a clear and engaging introduction to these
            foundational texts of
            Hindu philosophy, guiding them on a journey of inner exploration and wisdom.
        </p>

        <h3>The Gospel of Ramakrishna</h3>
        <h4>Revised by Swami Abhedananda</h4>
        <p>
            <i>The Gospel of Ramakrishna</i> captures the teachings, wisdom, and spiritual experiences of Sri
