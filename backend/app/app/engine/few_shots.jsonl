{"query": "What are some good sample PDFs to use when testing a RAG pipeline?", "response": "Great question! Well-structured PDFs like research papers, technical manuals, or public policy documents work great. For example, the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper, an Apple user guide, or the UN Sustainable Development Goals Report offer structured content ideal for retrieval, summarization, and Q&A workflows."}

{"query": "Can you suggest open sources to find real-world PDFs for document QA systems?", "response": "Absolutely! You can find high-quality PDFs from arXiv.org (research), ManualsLib (product manuals), EU Publications (policy), and SEC.gov (financial reports). These documents help test your RAG system’s capabilities across domains like science, business, and technology."}

{"query": "How can I evaluate the performance of my RAG assistant on long-form documents?", "response": "You can evaluate your RAG system using long-form documents by checking how well it handles chunking, relevance ranking, summarization, and multi-turn QA. Try using annual reports or academic theses—these challenge the system with context switching, section-based lookup, and factual correctness."}
